In Java, data is stored in variables, which can have different data types

Data Types:
    Data types in Java are divided into two main categories:
    1. Primitive Data Types
    2. Non-Primitive Data Types (to be discussed in upcoming chapters)

Primitive data types: 
    Primitive data types in Java are the foundational building blocks of data manipulation. 
    Unlike more complex data structures, they represent simple values such as a single number or character. 
    Java offers eight primitive types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean and 
    it can be further classified into the following sub-categories:
    1. Integer types
    2. Floating-point types
    3. Character type
    4. Boolean type

Detailed Breakdown of Primitive Data Types
    1. Integer
    The integer data types are used for storing whole numbers, which include natural numbers, zeros, 
    and negative numbers. Different integer data types are available based on the range and size 
    required:
    ● byte: 1 byte (8 bits), range: -128 to 127
    ● short: 2 bytes (16 bits), range: -32,768 to 32,767
    ● int: 4 bytes (32 bits), range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1
    ● long: 8 bytes (64 bits), range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1 (use an 'L' suffix to specify a long literal, e.g., 123456789L)

    2. Character
    The char type is used to store a single character, such as a letter, digit, or symbol, enclosed in 
    single quotes (e.g., 'A'). It has a size of 2 bytes (16 bits) because Java uses the Unicode standard, 
    which accommodates a broader range of characters compared to ASCII

    3. Boolean
    The boolean type represents a truth value and can hold only two possible values: true or false. 
    It is primarily used in conditional statements. Unlike some other programming languages that 
    might represent boolean values with 0 and 1, Java strictly uses the keywords true and false. 
    This means that in Java, you cannot use integers to represent boolean values—only true or false 
    are valid. 
    
    In Java, the boolean data type is unique compared to languages that might allow numerical 
    representations (like 0 for false and 1 for true). Java does not support 0 and 1 as boolean values. 
    The boolean data type strictly allows only two values: 
    ● true
    ● false
    
    This design decision helps prevent logical errors and ensures that conditions in your code are 
    clear and unambiguous.


    4. Float and Double
    These data types are used for storing decimal or floating-point numbers:
    ● float: 4 bytes, single-precision, range approximately ±3.40282347E+38F (use 'f' suffix, e.g., 3.14f)
    ● double: 8 bytes, double-precision, range approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (default for decimal numbers)

    Sizes and Ranges of Primitive Data Types
    Data Type   Size        Range                       Example
    byte        1 byte      -128 to 127                 byte b = 100;
    short       2 bytes     -32,768 to 32,767           short s = 3000;
    int         4 bytes     -2^31 to 2^31 - 1           int i = 123489;
    long        8 bytes     -2^63 to 2^63 - 1           long l = 123456789L;
    float       4 bytes     ±3.40282347E+38F            float f = 3.14f;
    double      8 bytes     ±1.79769313486231570E+308   double d = 3.14159;
    char        2 bytes     0 to 65,535 (Unicode)       char c = 'A';
    boolean     1 bit       true or false               boolean flag = true

public class DataType {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 10;

        byte b = 127;

        short s = 13365;

        long l = 3456789l;

        float f = 456.45f;

        double d = 4567.4567;

        char c = 'D';

        boolean bool = true;
        
    }
}

This Java program demonstrates the declaration and initialization of
various primitive data types, including `int`, `byte`, `short`, `long`, `float`,
`double`, `char`, and `boolean`. Each variable is assigned a specific value
to illustrate how these data types can be used in Java.
