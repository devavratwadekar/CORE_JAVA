# Literals in Java:
    Literals in Java represent fixed values directly in the source code. 
    They are constants that can be assigned to variables and come in various 
    types.

# Types of Literals in Java:
Java supports several types of literals, including:
    1. Integer Literals
    2. Character Literals
    3. Boolean Literals
    4. String Literals
    5. Floating Point Literals

# Detailed Explanation of Each Literal Type:
    1. Integer Literals
        Integer literals represent whole numbers and can be expressed in four different number systems:
        ● Decimal (Base 10): Uses digits 0-9.
            int decimal = 101; // Decimal literal
        ● Octal (Base 8): Uses digits 0-7, prefixed with 0.
            int octal = 0146; // Octal literal (equals 102 in decimal)
        ● Hexadecimal (Base 16): Uses digits 0-9 and letters a-f (or A-F), prefixed with 0x or 0X.
            int hex = 0x123Face; // Hexadecimal literal
        ● Binary (Base 2): Uses digits 0 and 1, prefixed with 0b or 0B.
            int binary = 0b1111; // Binary literal (equals 15 in decimal)

    2. Character Literals
        Character literals are single characters enclosed in single quotes. They can also
        represent special characters using escape sequences.
        char letter = 'a';
        char symbol = '%';
        char unicodeChar = '\u000d'; // Unicode representation

    3. Boolean Literals
        Boolean literals represent truth values and can only be true or false.
        boolean isJavaFun = true;
        boolean isFishMammal = false;

    4. String Literals
        String literals are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.
        String name = "Jack";
        String number = "12345";
        String newLine = "\n"; // Newline character

    5. Floating Point Literals
        Floating point literals represent numbers with fractional parts and can be of type
        float or double.
        ● Float Literals: Ends with F or f.
        float price = 19.99f;
        ● Double Literals: Ends with D or d (optional).
        double weight = 65.7;
        double scientific = 1.234e2; // Exponent notation

# Invalid Literals and Restrictions
    Using underscores in numeric literals can enhance readability, but there are restrictions:
    ● Cannot start or end a number with an underscore.
    ● Cannot place an underscore adjacent to a decimal point in a floating-point literal.
    ● Cannot place an underscore adjacent to F or L suffixes.

    Invalid Examples:
    int invalid = 77_; // Invalid: underscore at the end
    float invalidFloat = 6_.674F; // Invalid: underscore before decimal

# Why Use Literals?
    Literals are used to directly assign values to variables without needing to define constants 
    separately. They simplify code by embedding constant values within the instructions.

# FAQs on Literals
1. What are literals in Java?
    Literals are fixed values assigned directly to variables in the source code.

2. Can literals be changed during program execution?
    No, literals are constants and cannot be changed once defined.

3. What is a real literal?
    Real literals represent floating-point numbers, like 12.34 or 1.23e3.

4. What is a null literal?
    A null literal represents the absence of an object reference, commonly assigned as null.
