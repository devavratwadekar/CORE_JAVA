# Operators in Java
    Operators are symbols that perform specific operations on one or more operands. In Java, we commonly use operators for basic arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), as well as for other functions like modulus (%).

● Addition (+): Adds two operands.
● Subtraction (-): subtracts the second operand from the first.
● Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
● Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second, giving the quotient.
● Modulus (%) : Returns the remainder after division.

# Increment and Decrement Operators
    The increment (++) and decrement (--) operators always change the value by 1.
    These can be applied in two forms: pre and post.

● Pre-increment (++x)/Pre-decrement (--x): Increases or decreases the value before the operation is performed.
● Post-increment (x++) / post-decrement (x--): Increases or decreases the value after the operation is performed.


# Key Differences:
● Pre-increment/decrement: Modifies the variable's value before using it in an expression.
● Post-increment/decrement: Uses the variable's original value in the expression before modifying it.
