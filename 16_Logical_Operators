# Logical Operators
    Logical operators in Java are used to perform logical operations on boolean expressions. 
    These operators are crucial for decision-making in programs.
    Heres a breakdown of the main logical operators:

    1. Logical AND (& and &&)
    ● & (Bitwise AND): Evaluates both operands.
    ● && (Short-Circuit AND): Evaluates the second operand only if the first is true.

    Both conditions (x > y) and (a < b) are true, so the result is true.

    2. Logical OR (| and ||)
    ● | (Bitwise OR): Evaluates both operands.
    ● || (Short-Circuit OR): Evaluates the second operand only if the first is false.

    The first condition (x > y) is true, so the result is true regardless of the second condition.

    3. Logical NOT (!)
    ● !: Inverts the boolean value of an expression.

    Since (x < y) is false, !(x < y) becomes true.

    4. Logical XOR (^)
    ● If precisely one operand is true, the function returns true; if not, it returns false.

    Both (x > y) and (a < b) are true, so the XOR result is false


# Key Points
    ● Logical AND (&&) and Logical OR (||)
    are short-circuit operators, meaning they can skip evaluating the second operand if the result is already determined 
    by the first operand.

    ● Logical NOT (!) negates the boolean value of an expression.

    ● Logical XOR (^) is true only if exactly one of the operands is true.
