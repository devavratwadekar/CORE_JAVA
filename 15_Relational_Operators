# Relational Operators
    Java Relational Operators are binary operators that are used to evaluate relationships between two operands, such as 
    equality, greater than, less than, and so on. These comparisons return boolean results, and they are commonly used in 
    looping statements, conditional if-else statements, and similar constructs. The standard format for representing a 
    relational operator is:

Syntax:
variable1 relational_operator variable2

# implementation:

Equality (==)   : Checks if two values are equal.
Inequality (!=) : Checks if two values are not equal.
Greater than (>): checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
Less than (<)   : Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
Less than or equal to (<=)   : Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand
